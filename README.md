# Inbox-Solidity-Ethereum
A very basic project to demonstrate beginner level affinity with ethereum Rinkeby network as well as solidity programming. Deployed using infura. Can't be seen live because of security constraints.  
  
The deployment requires a 12 word mnemonic phrase which can't be shared publically on github hence the project can't be seen live. Clone the repo and modify the code accordingly to reproduce.

A lot of the functions have been deprecated in newer solidity versions.
